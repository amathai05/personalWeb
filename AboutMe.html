    <h2>Hey! My name is Alex!</h2>

    <p> 
        Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by computers
        and problem-solving. My earliest inspiration came from watching
        my father repair computers for friends, church members, and even
        strangers. Sitting beside him, I was captivated by the intricate
        components inside a computer, all working together to create something
        so powerful and transformative.

        That early exposure shaped my passion for puzzles and challenges, which
        naturally evolved into a love for programming. To me, programming
        is like an endless puzzle, where each challenge offers countless strategies,
        languages, and methods to explore. The thrill of crafting creative
        solutions and seeing them come to life keeps me constantly engaged
        and excited about what's next.
