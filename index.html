    <p>
        Ever since I was young, I have aspired to follow in my father's footsteps 
        by pursuing a career in Computer Science. As far back as I can remember, 
        I watched my father fix computers for various peopleâ€”whether they were 
        from our church, his friends, or even strangers he met at the store.
        My father would always take me along when he visited the homes of 
        people he had recently met, fixing their computers, and I would sit 
        and watch in fascination. In my mind, I would ponder over the intricate wires 
        and components scattered around the computer, all coming together in a 
        majestic way that allowed someone to "enter the internet".
